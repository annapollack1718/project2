Blog post #3

The first piece I want to discuss a piece called "Predictive Art Bot" by the art collective Disnovation. 
The piece uses an algorithm that takes buzzwords from current news headlines and generates titles for 
potential art projects. The algorithm creates ridiculous (and funny) titles,and proposes serious 
(and prophetic) projects. It is intersting to me since it expands conceptions of what creativity and
imagination mean for artists/humans. It also reveals something about the ridiculous nature of online
news that we are exposed to by juxtaposing a crazy sounding art project to actual headlines I see
during my online experience. The uncanniness between the two reveals the modularity of online experience 
as very close to what we can categorize as 'art'.

The second piece I want to discuss is a collection called "Postcards from Google Earth" by the artist
Clement Valla. The pieces are all 'screenshots' or captures of Google Earth images that have been 
distorted by a malfunction in the algorithm/computer/camera/satellite coupling that generates them.
Although this piece does not use algorithms in its execution, we still see the effects of its malfunction.
Again, this is an uncanny piece in that it both reminds us of what we see when we go on Google maps/Earth, 
and also it has a very strong surrealist undertone to it. In the same way that surrealist art gave a look 
into the unconscious, I think these examples of glitch art can give us a glimpse into the workings of the
unconscious of the algorithm - or in other words the processes in the mind of the computer which occur automatically
but are actually not available in for raw access.
